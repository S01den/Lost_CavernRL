A big screen is recommended.
If the menus are weirdly displayed, try to launch in minimal mode (134\*43) with ./LostCavern 1
The default keyboard type is QWERTY.

Keys: 
- Arrows to move
- zsqd to attack (aewx in diagonal) or qsad on a qwerty keyboard (to change the keyboard type, go to the menu and select the option "CHANGE KEYBOARD"), interact with a npc or destroy a wall
- 'c' to display the crafting menu
- ',' to dispaly the quest menu
- ESC to display the help menu
- ENTER to use your special power
- a number between 1 and 9 to use an object which is in your inventory

 ************* TRICKS & TIPS *************
- Don't forget that you can (and should !) destroy walls.
- You must pick gems with a melee weapon.
- Use the shields ! (you can craft them in the crafting menu)
- Fire cancels radioactivity
- Block a sentry with shield and then kill it easily with ranged weapons
- The resistance of crystal armor and the damage of the crystal sword (two legendary items) depends on the number of gems the player owns.
- Guardians are stupid and follow you, so lure them into trap.
