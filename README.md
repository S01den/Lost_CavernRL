A big screen is recommended.
If the menus are weirdly displayed, try to launch with minimal mode (./LostCavern 1)

Keys: 
- Arrows to move
- zsqd to attack (aewx in diagonal), interact with a npc or destroy a wall
- 'c' to display the crafting menu
- ',' to dispaly the quest menu
- <ESC> to display the help menu
- <ENTER> to use your special power
- a number between 1 and 9 to use an object which is in your inventory

 ************* TRICKS & TIPS *************
- Don't forget that you can (and should !) destroy walls.
- You must pick gems with a contact weapon.
- Use the shields ! (you can craft them in the crafting menu)
- Fire cancel radioactivity
- Block a sentry with shield and then kill it easily with distance weapons
- The resistance of crystal armor and the damages of the crystal sword (two legendary items) depends on the number of gems the player own.
- Guardians are stupids and follow you, so lead them in traps.
